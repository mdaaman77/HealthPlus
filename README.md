# HealthPlus Backend

HealthPlus is a Node.js/Express backend for a healthcare platform that supports user authentication, doctor and patient profiles, appointment scheduling, and email-based OTP verification.

---

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Signup/login with JWT-based authentication and role-based access (patient, doctor, admin).
- **OTP Email Verification**: Secure signup with OTP sent via email.
- **Doctor & Patient Profiles**: Separate schemas and profile management for doctors and patients.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Patients can book, modify, and cancel appointments with doctors.
- **Automatic Appointment Cleanup**: Appointments are automatically deleted 30 minutes after their scheduled time.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Middleware to restrict access to patient/doctor/admin routes.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Uses Mongoose for schema modeling and data validation.
- **Environment Configuration**: Uses `.env` for sensitive configuration.
